# Student Grade Calculator

This is a simple **Java program** that calculates student grades based on their marks.  
I built this project during my internship tasks.

## Features
- Takes input of marks in different subjects  
- Calculates total marks and percentage  
- Assigns grades (A, B, C, D, Fail) based on percentage  

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- IntelliJ IDEA  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA  
3. Run the `StudentGradeCalculator.java` file  

## Example Output
Enter marks for 5 subjects:
80 75 90 85 70

Total Marks = 400
Percentage = 80%
Grade = A
